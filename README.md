# File Processor Script

This Python script reads the contents of a specified input file, converts the text to uppercase, and writes the modified content to a new file called `output.txt`.

## How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter the name of the input file.
2. Reads the content of the input file.
3. Converts the content to uppercase.
4. Writes the result to `output.txt`.
5. Handles errors like:
   - File not found
   - Input/output errors
   - Other unexpected exceptions

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed and your terminal is in the correct directory. Then run:

```bash
python file_processer.py
